******************************
*Raspberry Pi 4: 4 Pi Cluster*
******************************

Why am I doing this?:
I know the idea of a Pi cluster has been overdone to the moon and back at this point. 
I'm mostly interested in learning on low risk hardware and the Pis happened to be the one thing I had enough identical units of. 
I'm not planning on doing anything major with it at this point. 
I may end up hosting a small personal website on the cluster at some point in the future, depending on a few factors. 
For the time being it's mostly going to be used for learning automation and some light containerization. 
At some point I'd like to scale up to larger / more powerful hardware, but for right now this is as big as I'm going with it.

**Layout:**
1x Rpi acting as controller node.
3x Rpis acting as worker nodes.
128GB thumb drive acting as a small network share for centralized storage.
8-port unmanaged switch attached to main network for connectivity.

**Issues Encountered:**
10/24/23:
USB drive acting as storage for the cluster was causing the main node, pinode01 to hang at boot.
Issue ended up being related to the UUID having changed at some point, from the time the NFS install was done.
Solution was to run 'sudo lsblk' to check the partition, and 'sudo blkid' to get the new UUID of the drive.
After the new UUID was obtained, edited the '/etc/fstab' file with the new UUID and rebooted the cluster.
After the nodes had all rebooted and found the "new" storage, created a test file and was able to access on all nodes.

10/31/23:
Set up Prometheus & Grafana on the controller Pi for the cluster for easier monitoring.
-Ran into difficulties setting up the systemd service due to a configuration error in the guide I was following.
-Also ran into issues importing the GPG key for the Grafana repo in APT.
-Resolved by using apt-key export to move the key to the correct directory and continued with no issues.

11/6/23:
Have been monitoring the cluster for a few days now to see how it goes when left alone.
Had an incident where all dashboards crashed in Grafana due to a hostname issue.
Found the hostname to be incorrectly setup and when the service restarted it couldn't collect any data.

11/22/23:
Currently working on setting up containers with Podman as well as setting up services in systemd for containers.

11/28/23:
Currently dealing with a recurring issue that causes one or more of the nodes to stall after booting.
Issue seems to be related to a service getting hung during boot preventing proper startup.
