# cluster-project

This is a project I'm currently working on to dip my feet into the concept of clustering. I'm sure there's better ways to do it, and I'll most likely explore those at some point in the future. 

Right now this cluster won't be doing much other than being a learning aid for new ideas. 

I'll be documenting everything I do with the cluster, as well as any scripts or playbooks that get made for it.

As always all code in this project is licensed under the GPLv3.0 license, and is fully and freely available to anyone.
